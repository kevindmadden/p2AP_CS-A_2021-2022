If the length of the str parameter can vary, then you will likely need to make use of str.length() in order to avoid out outOfBounds errors.

^^ length is 3 because there are 3 character


So.. if you call .length() on a string and subtract 1, that will give you the final index number of the string.



Use .indexOf if you are trying to locate a specific word/fragment inside of a larger string.

When you use .substring, it can be useful to store the substring you pull out in a well-named variable. Then you can just refer to that variable in if-statements, which can make your code waaaaay easier to read.

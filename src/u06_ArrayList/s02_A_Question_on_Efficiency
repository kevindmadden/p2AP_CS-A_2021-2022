Scenario:
-You have a single ArrayList with the variable name: squid
-squid contains exactly one of each integer between 0 and 200,000,000
-The ordering of the integers in squid is completely random

Task:
-Pick a random integer between 0 and 200 million. Determine what the index location is of your chosen random integer.

Question:
-What would be an efficient way to complete this task?
-Brainstorm and come up with an idea. Then I'll ask people to share.

Possible Solutions:
-Scan through array one element at a time, checking each number until you find the right one.

Task #2:
-Do the previous task 100,000,000 of times with a new random integer each time.

Possible Solutions:
-Do the previous solution 100,000,000 times.
-Same as above, except remove numbers you find.

Question: Would it be easier to search the list if the list was sorted (in order)?
-You have 200 million integers in order in an ArrayList.

Takeaway: Sorting a list of items can simplify looking something up in that list.
